This is my SNOW Tutorial for PDF Creation/Editing using the ServiceNow Plugin for PDFGenerator.
It's supposed to be able to create a PDF (from scratch) by leveraging an existing HTML Document Template.
But that seems to always involve the HR Application for SNOW.  (Full Blown, Install, and $$$ Contract).

Not entirely sure how to build a Fillable-PDF from scratch otherwise.
But there is a website with a Tutorial.. that includes a Fillable PDF that can be used.

See the sample pdf he provides "TestFormDylanLindgrenCom"
See my Powerpoint-ish tutorial slides explaining how to find/download/install the SNOW PDF Generator project.
See my Powerpoint-ish tutorial on an online article showing how to use 3 lines of code to modify and attach a PDF to a record.

The .XML file is how ServiceNow manages an entire Unit of Work for backing-up / re-installing changeds. (essentially a branch).
